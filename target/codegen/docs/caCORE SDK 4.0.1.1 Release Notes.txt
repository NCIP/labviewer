    caCORE SDK 1.0

    --  31 January 2005

    The caCORE Software Development Kit (SDK) is a set of tools
    that can be used by an intermediate Java developer to create
    a 'caCORE-like' system. Such systems are constructed using
    certain design principles:

    --  UML Modeling

    --  n-tier architecture with open APIs

    --  controlled vocabularies

    --  registered metadata

    A system built along these lines is said to be 'semantically
    integrated', that is, there exists runtime metadata that
    describes every class and class attribute in the API.

================================================================
	3.0 Bug Fixes Since Last Release
================================================================

    -- [#17208] Security issues with GetXML and GetHTML API  


================================================================
	4.0 Known Issues
================================================================

    -- [#13168] Polymorphic Implicit Inheritance queries fail if 
	firstResult/maxResult is set prior to executing query


    -- The SDK will not generate both ends of bi-directional 
	 associations within the Java Beans.

    -- The caCORE Castor-based Marshaller does not currently handle 
	 recursive bi-directional associations.	

    -- The SDK purposely ignores the lower-bound multiplicity
	 value from the UML model when generating the Schemas.  A
	 deployment option/property will be provided in a future 
	 release that will force the SDK to honor the value placed
	 within the model.

    -- When building a system, an error will be generated if
	 Java keywords are used as class and/or attribute names in
	 the UML logical model.  Similarly, SQL keywords in the
	 data model will generate errors.
   
    -- If you use multiple datasources from different databases
	 servers, the toolkit will not be able to generate
	 multiple orm*.cfg.xml files automatically. You will need
	 to generate a single ORM, then manually split that file
	 into however many ORM's you are using.

    -- The HTTP interface has reserved characters like % and #.
	 If the reserved characters are part of the query, the
	 HTTP parser will not work correctly.
	
	 Example:  "test%122".  

	 A workaround is to use the wild card character '*':

	 Example:  "test*122"

    -- A GForge Support tracker group, which is actively monitored by caCORE SDK 
       developers, has been created to track any support requests. If you believe 
       there is a bug/issue in the caCORE SDK software itself, or have a technical 
       issue that cannot be resolved by contacting the NCICB Application Support group, 
       please submit a new support tracker using the following link: 

       https://gforge.nci.nih.gov/tracker/?group_id=148&atid=731. 

    -- Prior to submitting a new tracker, review any existing support request trackers 
       in order to help avoid duplicate submissions.

	7.0 Documentation
================================================================
    
    -- The caCORE SDK 4.0.1 provides two guides.  The first, the "caCORE
       4.0 SDK Developer's Guide", combines information formerly 
       contained within the caCORE SDK Programmer's, Technical, and 
       Basic Installation and Test guides.  The second, the "caCORE 
       4.0 SDK Migration Guide", contains information on migrating from
       previous versions of the SDK.

    -- The caCORE SDK Developer's Guide can be downloaded via
       FTP from:

       http://nci.nih.gov/pub/cacore/SDK/caCORE_SDK4.0_Developers_Guide.pdf

    -- The caCORE SDK Migration Guide can be downloaded via
       FTP from:

       http://nci.nih.gov/pub/cacore/SDK/caCORE_SDK4.0_Migration_Guide.pdf

    -- JavaDocs are also available for the generated domain classes.  
       To view them, first build the system for your model using the 
       instructions contained in "Chapter 9 Configuring and Running 
       the SDK" of the caCORE 4.0 Developer's Guide.  The JavaDocs 
       are generated within the /output/<project_name>/build/docs
       folder, and also included in the project WAR file located in 
       /output/<project_name>/package/webapp/ directory.  Once the 
       WAR file is deployed, the JavaDocs are also viewable online 
       via the "JavaDocs" link on the SDK Home page.
