    caCORE SDK 1.0

    --  31 January 2005

    The caCORE Software Development Kit (SDK) is a set of tools
    that can be used by an intermediate Java developer to create
    a 'caCORE-like' system. Such systems are constructed using
    certain design principles:

    --  UML Modeling

    --  n-tier architecture with open APIs

    --  controlled vocabularies

    --  registered metadata

    A system built along these lines is said to be 'semantically
    integrated', that is, there exists runtime metadata that
    describes every class and class attribute in the API.

    +---------------------------------------+
    | Updates / New Features                |
    +---------------------------------------+

    caCORE SDK 4.1 Early Access is a major release with several new features available. 
	A list highlighting the functionality and performance enhancements and improvements introduced 
    in the caCORE SDK 4.1 early release is provided below. In addition, there are
    several new features developed in the 4.0.1 release since 4.0 release; details for 
    which can be found in its release notes document. 


	-- Codegen support for hibernate mapping files
	Users can now specify the settings in the code generator to specify primary
	key generators, cascade settings, inverse of settings etc. SDK also assumes
	a system wide primary key generator if one do not want to specify a class
	level generator
	
	-- Writable API
	caCORE SDK 4.1 now has an option to provide write access to the data source. 
	The user can enable the writable api by turning on a flag in the deploy.properties
	file. The writable api will allow user to create/update/delete the record
	
	-- Batch operations
	Users can spcify the operations to be performed in batch for the writable api.
	As part of the sequence, user can create and delete two different objects in the 
	same transaction. 
	
	-- Transaction support
	SDK transactions are managed from the external transaction manager. Users can 
	integrate SDK's write capabilities with their existing system and can execute
	all the operations within the same transaction
	
	-- Writable API security
	SDK generated writable api has security integrated which allows users to configure
	the access rights using CSM's UPT tool
	
	-- Group level security in local client
	SDK users will now be able to pass the Group names while obtaining a handle to the
	ApplicationService. This feature will allow them to use instance level security 
	using group names
	
	-- Validation support with caDSR enumerated validator
	caCORE SDK can now connect to the caDSR to download the enumerated values and use
	it in the validator. User just have to turn the flag to enable the functionality.
	This feature will work only with the writable api
	
	-- Integrated support for CLM based logging
	When writable api is enabled, one can enable CLM based loggin in SDK. This feature
	will create log statement for any changes made to the database by using Example like
	query for manipulation purpose. 

================================================================
	3.0 Bug Fixes Since Last Release
================================================================

    -- [#14781] Please correct misspellings in TransformerUtils
	-- [#13727] HQL query exception with more than 1000 results
	-- [#12987] Problems with queries across more than 1 level of inheritance


================================================================
	4.0 Known Issues
================================================================

	-- [#15102] Attribute level security when enabled with the writable api 
	causes issues with associations
	
    -- [#13168] Polymorphic Implicit Inheritance queries fail if 
	firstResult/maxResult is set prior to executing query

    -- The SDK will not generate both ends of bi-directional 
	 associations within the Java Beans.

    -- The caCORE Castor-based Marshaller does not currently handle 
	 recursive bi-directional associations.	

    -- The SDK purposely ignores the lower-bound multiplicity
	 value from the UML model when generating the Schemas.  A
	 deployment option/property will be provided in a future 
	 release that will force the SDK to honor the value placed
	 within the model.

    -- When building a system, an error will be generated if
	 Java keywords are used as class and/or attribute names in
	 the UML logical model.  Similarly, SQL keywords in the
	 data model will generate errors.
   
    -- If you use multiple datasources from different databases
	 servers, the toolkit will not be able to generate
	 multiple orm*.cfg.xml files automatically. You will need
	 to generate a single ORM, then manually split that file
	 into however many ORM's you are using.

    -- The HTTP interface has reserved characters like % and #.
	 If the reserved characters are part of the query, the
	 HTTP parser will not work correctly.
	
	 Example:  "test%122".  

	 A workaround is to use the wild card character '*':

	 Example:  "test*122"

	7.0 Documentation
================================================================
    
    -- The caCORE SDK 4.0 provides two guides.  The first, the "caCORE
       4.0 SDK Developer's Guide", combines information formerly 
       contained within the caCORE SDK Programmer's, Technical, and 
       Basic Installation and Test guides.  The second, the "caCORE 
       4.0 SDK Migration Guide", contains information on migrating from
       previous versions of the SDK.

    -- The caCORE SDK Developer's Guide can be downloaded via
       FTP from:

       http://nci.nih.gov/pub/cacore/SDK/caCORE_SDK4.0_Developers_Guide.pdf

    -- The caCORE SDK Migration Guide can be downloaded via
       FTP from:

       http://nci.nih.gov/pub/cacore/SDK/caCORE_SDK4.0_Migration_Guide.pdf

    -- JavaDocs are also available for the generated domain classes.  
       To view them, first build the system for your model using the 
       instructions contained in "Chapter 9 Configuring and Running 
       the SDK" of the caCORE 4.0 Developer's Guide.  The JavaDocs 
       are generated within the /output/<project_name>/build/docs
       folder, and also included in the project WAR file located in 
       /output/<project_name>/package/webapp/ directory.  Once the 
       WAR file is deployed, the JavaDocs are also viewable online 
       via the "JavaDocs" link on the SDK Home page.
