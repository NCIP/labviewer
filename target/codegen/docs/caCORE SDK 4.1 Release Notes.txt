    caCORE SDK 1.0

    --  31 January 2005

    The caCORE Software Development Kit (SDK) is a set of tools
    that can be used by an intermediate Java developer to create
    a 'caCORE-like' system. Such systems are constructed using
    certain design principles:

    --  UML Modeling

    --  n-tier architecture with open APIs

    --  controlled vocabularies

    --  registered metadata

    A system built along these lines is said to be 'semantically
    integrated', that is, there exists runtime metadata that
    describes every class and class attribute in the API.

    +---------------------------------------+
    | Updates / New Features                |
    +---------------------------------------+

    caCORE SDK 4.1 is a major release with several new features available. 
    Some of the newly developed features are to improve the infrastructure 
    and others are to support new requirements. A list highlighting the
    functionality and performance enhancements and improvements introduced 
    in the caCORE SDK 4.1 release is provided below.

    -- Abstract classes. See GForge [#2958] caIntegrator suggestions for more info.
  
       Previous versions of the caCORE SDK ignored the property of the UML class 
       that indicated that the class was abstract (i.e. one cannot create an 
       instance of the generated class). The SDK 4.1 is now capable of recognizing 
       the abstract property of the UML class and generating appropriate artifacts. 

       Note: Like interfaces, abstract class cannot be instantiated
       (i.e. you cannot create an object from an abstract class), and
       so will not be searchable via the UI or any of the SDK API's.

    -- Marker Interfaces. See GForge [#2958] caIntegrator suggestions for more info.

       Interfaces without any constant member variables and methods are known as 
       marker interfaces. For example, java.io.Serializable is a marker interface 
       which tells the JVM that the class data can be serialized into a byte stream. 
       Using a similar principle, the SDK allows users to specify the marker 
       interfaces in their UML model that the domain objects can implement. 

       Examples include:

       - java,lang.Cloneable
       - java,io.Serializable
       - java.util.EventListener

       Note: An interface cannot be instantiated (i.e. you cannot create
       an object from an Interface), and so will not be searchable via
       the UI or any of the SDK API's.

    -- Implicit Polymorphism.  See GForge [#11539] Support for Hibernate Impilicit 
       Inheritance for more info.

       Abstract classes are classes which cannot be instantiated. When they are 
       mapped to the database, they do not possess independent mapping in the 
       database. In these cases, the attributes and the associations of the 
       parent class are mapped in the table for the child class. The SDK 4.1 
       release now supports this mapping strategy. 
       
       Support for Hibernate Implicit Inheritance has now been added to SDK 4.0.1.
	For more details on this form of Inheritance Mapping, see:

       -- http://www.hibernate.org/hib_docs/v3/reference/en/html_single/#inheritance
       -- http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-hibernate/
	   
     -- Writable API Enhancements.  The SDK now supports the generation of a system 
	which includes full Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.  See 
	GForge Release Development items [#13288] Writable API in Java client and [#13289] 
	Security in the writable API for more information.
	   
        Code Generation changes related to the Writable API functionality include:	   
	-- Primary Key Generator
	-- Not Null Foreign Keys Validation
	-- Hibernate Cascade Settings
	-- Hibernate Eager Load Settings
	-- Hibernate Inverse Associations Setting
	   
	Java API changes related to the Writable API functionality include:
	-- ApplicationService interface
	-- Support for DML Style Operations
	-- Support for Batch Operations
	-- SDK Validator integration (see Validator section below for more details)

     -- Auditing Logging
        As the data is being manipulated through the writable API, it is important 
	to maintain a trail of what is being manipulated. The caCORE SDK provides 
	an optional logging capability, which inserts the log statements into the
	database with help of Common Logging Module (CLM). CLM also provides a 
	companion application called Log Locator Tool, which allows users to 
	review the inserted log statements in a secured fashion.	   

     -- GME Namespace Support.  As part of the Grid integration and XML serialization,
	the SDK now provides support for the Global Model Exhange (GME) project Requirements.  
	See GForge Feature Request item [#12415] GME Namespace Cross Cutting Support   
	Development for more information, as well as the GME Wiki, located at 
	https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/CommonProjects/GME+Namespace.  In particular, 
	information on the SDK's support for the GME project requirements is located at: 
	https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/CommonProjects/caCORE+SDK+Support+GME+Project.
	   
     -- Validator Implementation.  The SDK now provides code generation support for  
	Hibernate Validator functionality within the generated Java POJO beans whenever  
	the writable API is enabled.  The SDK now also provides integrated query of the 
	caDSR, as well as user supplied validator configuration settings, for the purpose
	of supplying the permissible values to be used during POJO and XSD artifact 
	generation.  See GForge Feature Request items [#15747] Refreshing permissible 
	values in validator and [#16295] Providing User Specified Validation Constraints 
	in a Separate File, as well as GForge Release Development item [#13658] Provide 
	the ability to inject data validation into the Writeable APIs.
	   
     -- Security Enhancements.  Includes integration with the latest version of the Common
	Security Module (CSM),  Common Logging Module (CLM), the SDK Writable API, and the 
	Grid.  Also provides enhanced support for instance and attribute level security.  
	See GForge Release Development item [#13289] Security in the writable API, as well
	as [#15119] Grid Authentication Manager/Security Integration for more information.
	   
     -- Grid Integration.  The SDK now implements a new Authentication Manager which can 
	take a grid proxy as input. The manager retrieves user identification information
	from the proxy and then retrieves user account information from CSM so that it can 
	be used for authorization purposes.  CQL support is also provided.  See GForge 
	Release Development item [#15119] Grid Authentication Manager/Security Integration
	for more information. 
	
     -- Use of Regular Expressions in the Include/Exclude configuration properties within 
	deploy.properties file.  See GForge Feature Request item [#16581] Include/exclude 
	Properties should allow Regular Expression (regex) Patterns for more information.

================================================================
	4.0 Known Issues
================================================================

    -- [#16327] Pagination of result set causes incorrect construction of the result list

    -- The criteria query page is not displayed for implicit classes. See
	   [#15722] No Criteria page for the implicit class Tank.	   

    -- [#13168] Polymorphic Implicit Inheritance queries fail if 
	firstResult/maxResult is set prior to executing query

    -- The SDK will not generate both ends of bi-directional 
	 associations within the Java Beans.

    -- The caCORE Castor-based Marshaller does not currently handle 
	 recursive bi-directional associations.	

    -- The SDK purposely ignores the lower-bound multiplicity
	 value from the UML model when generating the Schemas.  A
	 deployment option/property will be provided in a future 
	 release that will force the SDK to honor the value placed
	 within the model.

    -- When building a system, an error will be generated if
	 Java keywords are used as class and/or attribute names in
	 the UML logical model.  Similarly, SQL keywords in the
	 data model will generate errors.
   
    -- If you use multiple datasources from different databases
	 servers, the toolkit will not be able to generate
	 multiple orm*.cfg.xml files automatically. You will need
	 to generate a single ORM, then manually split that file
	 into however many ORM's you are using.

    -- The HTTP interface has reserved characters like % and #.
	 If the reserved characters are part of the query, the
	 HTTP parser will not work correctly.
	
	 Example:  "test%122".  

	 A workaround is to use the wild card character '*':

	 Example:  "test*122"
